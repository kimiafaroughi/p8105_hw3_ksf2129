## Problem 1

Load the dataset

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

There are 1384617 rows (observations) and 15 columns (variables) in the
`instacart` dataset. Each row in the dataset is a unique product from an
order from instacart. Variable names in this dataset include: order_id,
product_id, add_to_cart_order, reordered, user_id, eval_set,
order_number, order_dow, order_hour_of_day, days_since_prior_order,
product_name, aisle_id, department_id, aisle, department. Some variables
of note are `product_id` (the product identifier), `user_id` (the
customer identifier), `product_name` (name of the product ordered),
`aisle` (name of the aisle the product is in), and `department` (name of
the department the product is in). For example, for the product `49302`
and customer `112108`, the product ordered was `Bulgarian Yogurt`, which
was in the `dairy eggs` department in the `yogurt` aisle.
